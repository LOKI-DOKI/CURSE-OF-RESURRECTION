## 🧙 Storyline: A Soul for a Soul

In the aftermath of a tragic war, Erika’s husband **Wayne** dies under mysterious circumstances. Haunted by guilt and driven by love, Erika learns of an ancient legend — one that whispers of a **Death God** who governs the balance of souls. If she can reach his temple deep within **Dering Woods**, and offer a worthy exchange, she may be able to revive Wayne.

To get there, Erika must:
- Pass through **three cursed mountains** guarded by legendary beasts:  
  - 🐐 **Chupacabra** (Agile and unpredictable)  
  - 🔥 **Cerberus** (Brute force with fiery attacks)  
  - 🧟 **Wendigo** (The most terrifying, with psychological manipulation)  
- Navigate haunted ruins, forest paths, and ancient shrines  
- Discover the **cost of resurrection** — a soul for a soul
